Coding Dojo Fullstack Django Assignment

Assignment: Semi-Restful TV Shows Validated
Objectives:
Practice validating data before entering it into the database
Let's add validations to your existing Semi-Restful TV Shows assignment! Building off of your existing assignment, implement the validations indicated on the green sticky notes to prevent dirty data from getting into your database. If a submission is invalid, display errors on the appropriate page.



 Validate the Add a TV Show form to ensure all fields are populated appropriately before adding to the database.
 Display errors on the Add a TV Show form if the information is invalid.
 Validate the Edit Show form with the same validations as creation.
 Display errors on the Edit Show form if the information is invalid.
 NINJA BONUS: Ensure the Release Date is in the past.
 NINJA BONUS: Allow the description to be optional. If a description is provided, though, it should still be at least 10 characters.
 SENSEI BONUS: Validate that a TV show with that title does not already exist in the database before creating or updating.
 SENSEI BONUS: Do uniqueness validations (including displaying errors) for creating and updating using AJAX!
